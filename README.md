## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned that in some cases, the semantic approach with Html tags closer to the design reality is not necessarily adapted to the styles to be applied. such as for stylizing <hr/> tags and list bullet points (::marker).

Instead of <hr/> I finally used simple stylized <div>.

```html
<div class="hr"></div>
```
```css
.hr {
  width: 100%;
  height: 1px;
  background-color: hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
}
```

Instead of styling li::marker on list bullet points I finally used a none styling list and some <span>
```html
<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="bullet">‚óè</span>
    <div class="list_content">2-3 large eggs</div>
  </li>
  ...
  
</ul>
```
```css
ul, ol{
    list-style: none;
}
li{
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    margin-bottom: 8px;
    padding-left: 8px;
}
.bullet{
    width: 16px;
    font-size: 8px;
    margin-right: 16px;
    color: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
}
```

### Continued development

I still have a lot to do, especially in terms of speed of execution. I'd also like to focus on the BEM method for writing my CSS.
